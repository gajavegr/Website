### School Projects

As a full-time Computer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, I spend most of my time working on stuff for class. I try to integrate as much of myself into every project, whether it's detailed documentation for complicated, code-heavy projects, to features that demonstrate a little bit of my personality. With the more open-ended projects I've had the chance to express myself more than before and have been able to achieve some cool results! Take a look at what I've been able to accomplish here!


### Personal Projects

The beauty of being a student is in the opportunities to use what I learn during breaks. I know that after college it will be hard to find dedicated times when I'm free to let my imagination go wild, but I'm very happy to take the opporuntity I have now by the reins! I love cars, puzzles, music, hard questions, and visualizing math! Here are some projects which take my passion for each of these and bring them to life with code! Click here to learn more!

### About Me

Although, this section is usually first, I like to let my work speak for itself. I am a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science double major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. With a love for cars and for programming, it's ofen my daily goal to find a way to make these two highly distinct fields meet. After lots of exploring, I believe I can achieve this goal in a personally meaningful and exciting way through contributions to the fields of automation, robotics, electric vehicles, and distributed systems. I sincerely believe I can help make the world a better place by passionately engaging in these fields, and for that reason I'm seeking internships in each of those respective fields.
